# Active-Overlay

## The Goal
Active Overlay is a C# library that allows end users to render graphics on top of a pre-existing program window. It is used for creating overlays (like Steam or Discord overlay). It was originally created for the Software Development category at the New Jersey Technology Student Association state conference where it won the third prize.

## Technologies
The library can interface with C#. The .NET Framework must be installed to use the library. [It can be found here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework). The latest version of the .NET Framework that has been teseted with this library is 4.8.

## Project Status
Currently, I am no longer working on this project. I, however, will be working on [Project Winux](https://github.com/ndnestor/Project-Winux) in the future which will be a successor of sorts to this project. It will use much of the same concepts and utilize what I have learned in this little experiment on a larger scale.
